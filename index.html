          <li>Born in  10 July 1856</li>
           <li>Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor and engineer who contributed to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</li>           
            <li>He patented an induction motor that ran on AC, a Tesla coil, a wireless lighting system, and a radio-controlled boat.</li>
             <li>He also experimented with X-rays, wireless power transmission, and global communications.</li>

             <h3>Tesla's projects and challenges</h3>

              <li>Tesla worked for Edison Machine Works, Westinghouse Electric, and his own companies, but often faced financial difficulties and competition from other inventors.</li>
              <li>He built a large coil in Colorado Springs to test his wireless power and communication ideas, but failed to find investors for his ambitious plans.</li>
              <li>He also built a tower in Wardenclyffe, New York, to transmit power and signals across the Atlantic, but it was never completed and was demolished in 1917.</li>

              <h3>Tesla's recognition and legacy</h3>
              
              <li>Tesla received several honors and awards, including the Edison Medal in 1917 and the unit of magnetic flux density named after him in 1960.</li>
              <li>He was involved in several patent disputes and lawsuits, some of which were resolved in his favor after his death.</li>
              <li>He died in New York City in 1943, leaving behind many unpublished notes and unfinished projects. His work inspired many later developments in science and technology.</li>
